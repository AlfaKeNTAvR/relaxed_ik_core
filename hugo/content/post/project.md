The core part of RelaxedIK is at [relaxed_ik_core](https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_core), however, it is usually not intended to be run alone. Here are three wrappers of RelaxedIK that we implemented for ROS, ROS2, and Unity.

### Relaxed IK ROS
Available at [relaxed_ik_ros1](https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_ros1).

This is a cleaner version of RelaxedIK wrapped up in ROS1 with pre-generated config files of some mostly used pre-computed robot arms. For the complete version, please follow this link [relaxed_ik](https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik).

### Relaxed IK ROS2 (Under developed)
Under developed at [relaxed_ik_ros2](https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_ros2).

This is Relaxed IK wrapped up in ROS2.

### Relaxed IK Unity
Available at [relaxed_ik_unity](https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik_unity).

This is the Unity wrapper of Relaxed IK designed to be run on Windows. The simulation of a few commonly used robot arms have already been set up to play with.
